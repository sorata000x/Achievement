## Feature
 - Tray drop-down box that displays achievement options
 - Options to create and record achievements
 - Collection window that displays completed goals

## To Do
 - Draw a complete icon for the achievement button
 - Hover effect for collection achievement button, like, the actual button
   should be a bit bigger so when hovering on the button there is some glow
   effect around the button.
 - Hover effect for the back buttons
 - Improve hover effect for the menu / achievement button so they looks bigger
   when hovering on it.
 - Move style in stylesheet.py to inline styles
 - Implement upload achievement icon
 
(after all these are done)

 - store user data with QSetting
 - input error detection
 - test the program well, make sure things work well as I intended and pay
   attention to the GUI display.
