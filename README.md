# RPGOverlay

## Feature

## Idea

## To Do
 - The delete buttons need rounded corners
 - Remove the edit button (both) probably don't need it
 - Remove the x for the achievement buttons they are ugly.
 - Draw a complete icon for the achievement button
 - Hover effect for collection achievement button, like, the actual button
   should be a bit bigger so when hovering on the button there is some glow
   effect around the button.
 - Hover effect for the back buttons
 - Improve hover effect for the menu / achievement button so they looks bigger
   when hovering on it.
 - Move style in stylesheet.py to inline styles
 - Implement upload achievement icon
 
(after all these are done)

 - store user data with QSetting
 - test the program well, make sure things work well as I intended and pay
   attention to the GUI display.
